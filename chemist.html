            <h1>Tragic chemists</h1>
    <p>
    Antoine-Laurent Lavoisier—his death was dramatic. <br>
Henry Cavendish—possibly an autism chemist.<br>
Marie Curie—the only female scientist who won the Nobel twice<br>
Tracy Hall—got only 25 $bonus for inventing synthetic diamond<br>
Carl Bosch—inventor of nitrogen fertilizer, a German scientist who later lost all his achievments and position because of he was against Hitler's policies.<br>
Henry Moseley—a brilliant physicist whose work laid strong foundation for Mendeleev’s periodic table and corrected some gaps in periodic table.<br>
        
But the World War one broke out, unlike many scientists who died tragically because of oppression, 
        He volunteered to join in the army and died in the war. <br>
       
        Fortunately, the British Government realized this loss and banned scientists from enlisting in the war. <br>
